SCP-093 'Red' Test</b></font></legend><hr>

<p><b>SCP-093 Mirror Test 5: Color (Red)</b></p>
<p>SCP-093 distributed amongst staff until a new color could be 
generated by contact with it. Service Technician &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; was able to 
cause SCP-093 take on a fierce red hue and glow, much brighter than the 
object's normal color. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; agreed to assist with a test of SCP-093. 
Per Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;'s request, &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;-&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; given to Technician &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; for use in 
this test. When applied to the mirror for the test, SCP-093 generates an
 unknown environment. No color tinge appears present on the displayed 
destination, which is comprised of red stonework. Technician &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; 
enters the mirror and video capture begins.</p>

<p>Video flickers to life and Technician &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, known hereafter as 
Subject, is viewing a large cylindrical pillar that is rotating on its 
own. Object is of unknown height and appears to be 1.8&nbsp;m (6 ft) in 
width. Holes are distributed throughout the object at seemingly random 
intervals. On occasion a beam of white light is emitted from these 
holes. Turning of the camera finds that the beams are connected to a 
multitude of objects similar to SCP-093 that are part of the room's 
wall. The room turns out to also be cylindrical in shape with countless 
copies of SCP-093.</p>
<p>Subject turns back to entry point and finds it is a section of the 
wall that is missing its copy of SCP-093, presumably the one carried 
with Subject. Other sections of the wall on inspection are also found to
 be missing their copies, leading to speculation that this may be some 
sort of central array. Subject finds a ladder in the floor while 
examining the room and proceeds down it at Control's request.</p>
<p>The ladder exits into a large clean room full of computer equipment 
that appears antiquated compared to previously encountered equipment. 
Large computers running on reel-to-reels are clicking and spinning at 
various locations, a light bulb of unknown meaning turns on for ten 
seconds then turns off. A large CRT monitor is displaying single words 
in 8 colors at roughly 5 second intervals. While observed the words 
'Clean' 'Unclean' 'Clean' 'Clean' 'Lost' 'Unclean' flash on the screen.</p>
<p>Proceeding through the room it ends in a large glass window as 
another observation deck. This deck looks out over another series of 
tubes as witnessed before but far fewer and filled with a blue liquid. 
What appears to be electrical current dances over many of the tubes at 
erratic intervals. At least five tubes at first glance are empty and 
broken. At the observation window a keyboard is present on a pedestal 
awaiting a selection to be made. The options available on the screen are
 'Tube Status' which waits for a numerical input, 'Reports', 'Situation 
X-549', 'Situation X-550', 'Evacuation Log', 'Agent &#9608;-&#9608;&#9608;-&#9608; 
Report', and 'Facility Fire Plan'. &lt;Video Expunged: All selections 
that generated text were transcribed by Subject and verified by a 
Control member who passed through the portal to recover them. This 
process took approximately two hours and video feed was deleted to 
condense this report. Recorded Documents are filed as &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;-&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;-&#9608;&#9608;&gt;
 Video Interrupted.</p></td></table></font>
<p>Control lost contact with Subject approximately 30 minutes after 
departure of Control tech. Subject was asked to remain in area and 
observe the machinery and the containment room to make observations for 
debriefing. The SCP-093 mirror portal returned to a reflective surface 
prematurely and all video contact with Subject was lost. Control was 
unable to re-establish due to SCP-093 being across the mirror. A time 
lapse of one minute and forty-eight seconds (1:48) was recorded before 
mirror portal re-established itself and Subject returned through portal.
 Subject appeared to be in good health and condition despite the time 
loss but spoke little.</p>
<p>During immediate debriefing Subject underwent sudden convulsions and 
medical staff was alerted. While attempting to subdue Subject he 
displayed enhanced strength and used &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;-&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; to shoot one of the 
debriefing staff, killing them. Guards shot Subject once with a sidearm 
in the heart and once in the chest but Subject did not fall. All staff 
evacuated room and a second shot was fired by Subject which missed. A 
more heavily armed team entered debriefing room and used automatic 
weapons to dispatch Subject. Reports confirm that Subject did not bleed 
when shot but instead leaked a green/brown substance that seemed to be a
 mix of solution observed in some containment tubes and the material 
recovered during Test 3.</p>
<p>All further SCP-093 tests have been discontinued while review of 
materials recovered is in effect. A secondary tape recording device was 
found to have activated in the field kit after loss of video feed and 
its contents have been filed with other recovered materials.</p>
<p>All recovered materials from SCP-093 testing are Level 3 
Classification. Release must be approved by no fewer than two Level 3 
personnel.</p>
<p>STAFF WITH ACCEPTABLE CLEARANCE PLEASE SIGN IN WITH DR. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; FOR ACCESS TO <b><a href=SCP-093recoveredmaterials.html>THE MATERIALS RECOVERED FROM SCP-093 TESTS</a></b></p></font></fieldset></body></html>
