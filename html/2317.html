<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2317 is a wooden door and frame 
originally constructed as a basement door for a 19th-century 
Massachusetts brownstone. Upon opening the door, any person stepping 
through the door frame will be transported to an alternate reality.</p>
<p>Exploration of the alternate reality (SCP-2317-Prime) is limited, but
 the area directly accessible through SCP-2317 is a salt pan several 
kilometers in radius. A circle of seven pillars (SCP-2317-A through 
SCP-2317-G) are positioned in a ten-meter diameter circle approximately 
ten meters directly in front of SCP-2317. Each pillar is approximately 
one meter in diameter, and seven meters tall, constructed of marble and 
engraved with a series of intricate bas-reliefs. The art style of the 
engravings do not correspond to that of any known modern, historic, or 
prehistoric civilization. <span style="color:blue;">SCP-2317-A-G extend two hundred meters below the surface of the sand and into SCP-2317-H.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">SCP-2317-H is a spherical space one hundred
 kilometers in diameter located directly underneath SCP-2317-A-G, lined 
with the same stone used to construct SCP-2317-A-G. Contained within 
SCP-2317-H is SCP-2317-K, hereafter referred to as "entity."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">The following information has been inferred
 through seismic analysis and ground-penetrating radar, as well as 
direct observation: Entity appears to be an obese humanlike creature of 
immense proportions: estimated height if fully erect is over two hundred
 kilometers. Horns resembling tree branches sprout from its head, which 
lacks a lower jaw. Entire body is covered in millions of overlapping 
plate-like scales. Seven heavy hooks are embedded in the entity's back, 
each one attached to a heavy steel chain connected to the lower end of 
one of the seven pillars embedded in the ceiling of the chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">At the time of the writing of this 
document, six of the pillars or chains have been broken or damaged, and 
only one chain remains intact.</span></p>

(SCP-2317-A), celebrant circumambulates SCP-2317-A through SCP-2317-G, 
proceeding counter-clockwise at an even and measured pace. At every 
other step, celebrant will scatter holy water, using the aspergillum and
 aspersorium, in the direction of the circle's center.</li>
<li>Upon completing one circumambulation of SCP-2317-A-G, celebrant 
scatters holy water over the head of the assistant and recites the 
following phrase: <span style="color:blue;">"<em>Seven Seals, Seven Rings, Seven Thrones for the Scarlet King.</em>"</span></li>
<li><span style="color:blue;">Celebrant then moves to a safe distance 
away from assistant, who will take the obsidian knife and use it to kill
 the chicken provided as sacrifice. Blood will be drained from the 
chicken and added to the aspersorium, then stirred to mix with the holy 
water already contained within.</span></li>
<li>Assistant then circumambulates SCP-2317-A-G in a clockwise 
direction, scattering the mixture of blood and holy water in the 
direction of the circle's center.</li>
<li>Upon completing one circumambulation of SCP-2317-A-G, assistant 
walks to the center of the circle of stones and pours the remaining 
mixture of blood and water onto the discolored patch of salt and sand in
 the center, while reciting the following phrase: <span style="color:blue;">"<em>Blood for the Old Gods, Water for the New King.</em>"</span></li>
<li>All materials are gathered up, the obsidian knife is secured, and 
all personnel return through SCP-2317, which is subsequently closed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure at any point to properly perform Procedure 220-Calabasas may 
result in an XK-Class End of the World Scenario. Should any mishap or 
failure occur, all personnel are to return immediately through SCP-2317,
 closing the door behind them. The containment chamber will be 
immediately locked down, and a Level Two Emergency declared and reported
 to the O5 Council. Further instructions will be provided to on-site 
personnel according to Emergency Order Zachariah, and may include 
detonation of on-site nuclear warhead.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;"><strong>Addendum 2317-2: History:</strong> 
SCP-2317 was first discovered in 1922, by [DATA EXPUNGED]. Object was 
subsequently moved to what was then called Provisional Containment Area 
17. Object was moved to Containment Area 179 in 1982, where it remains 
as of the writing of this article.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">When initially discovered, four of the 
seven chains were broken, and three were intact: the breaking of the 
fifth chain in ████ corresponded directly to a ██████████ event in our 
world. The sixth chain, which broke in ████, was also coincident with a 
much more severe ██████████ event, eventually resulting in the deaths of
 two million persons.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">Analysis of supplementary texts retrieved 
at the time of containment pointed to Procedure 220-Calabasas as an 
effective means of maintaining containment until an effective means of 
repairing or reattaching said chains can be discovered. Containment 
procedures were modified to incorporate Procedure 220-Calabasas. As 
records show that the sequence of ██████████ events shows an exponential
 increase in lethality, it can be extrapolated that failure of the final
 chain (SCP-2317-G), would result in an XK-Class End of the World 
Scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">For this reason, every possible effort is to be made to ensure a successful Procedure 220-Calabasas.</span></p>

<h1 id="toc5"><span>SCP-2317</span></h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2317</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Keter</span> Apollyon</p>
<p><strong>Clearance Designation:</strong> All O5 personnel.<br>
Level 4 or lower personnel authorized if cleared under CODE NIGHTMARE REGENT RED</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2317 is a primeval entity known as 
"The ████, Devourer of Worlds" (name redacted intentionally). The 
Erikesh Codex indicates that it was captured and imprisoned by Erikeshan
 mystics circa 1894 BCE. An excerpt from the relevant passage follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AND THEN KESHPETH LED HIS ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND INTO THE REALM BEYOND 
THE CLOUDS, AND THERE DID THEY DO BATTLE WITH THE DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME
 REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED. AND THEN KESHPETH AND HIS TEN THOUSAND DID
 CRAFT SEVEN CUNNING CHAINS OUT OF THE BONES OF JASPETAR, SEVENTH BRIDE 
OF THE DREAD DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED, AND 
BOUND HIM WITHIN THE PEARL OF THE FATHER OF OYSTERS, HE WHO DWELLS UNDER
 THE MIRROR OF SALT IN THE REALM UNDER THE SEA. AND KESHPETH ORDERED 
THAT THE GATES TO THE FAR COUNTRY BE SEALED FOREVER, LEST THE DREAD 
DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED, FIND ITS WAY BACK TO
 OUR WORLD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not clear how the 19th-century Society of the Golden Arrow 
discovered how to create a gate to Universe-Kappa-Erikesh, nor their 
reasons for doing so. What is clear is that the damage to the first four
 chains that bind the Devourer was accidental. By the time Our Founder 
took possession of the item following the dissolution of the Society, 
the organization had bankrupted itself several times over trying 
desperately to repair the damage caused.</p>
<p><strong>Projected Containment Profile:</strong> Indications are that 
Final Containment Failure will occur at some point within the next 
century as of the writing of this article: the mean time to failure 
being calculated at thirty years. All efforts to repair or replace the 
chains have failed. All efforts to re-discover the method for creating 
these chains have proven fruitless. Research is currently underway to 
determine an alternate containment plan, but the possibility that 
anything can keep the Devourer from entering our universe is slim, 
especially as the original material used to create the chains (namely, 
the bones and sinew of another Devourer entity) are no longer in 
existence.</p>
<p>The primary threat is internal despair or panic. In order to maintain
 morale, a false containment procedure (Procedure 220-Calabasas) will be
 authored and implemented. This false containment procedure has been 
given a sense of veracity by the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating elements of common ritualistic magics.</li>
<li>Incorporating elements of popular religious rites.</li>
<li>Incorporating elements of other known occult organizations.</li>
<li>Incorporating elements of other known Special Containment Procedures.</li>
<li>Incorporating references to similar but unrelated occult entities.</li>
<li>Increased information security regarding the elements of the procedure.</li>
<li>Appealing to the common institutional meme of the effectiveness of thermonuclear weapons in destroying paranormal entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although completely ineffectual, the purpose of Procedure 
220-Calabasas is to provide the appearance of active containment in 
order to allay anxiety among staff until a more permanent solution can 
be found.</p>
<p>In the meantime, preparations will be made in order to ensure the 
survival of the human race following Containment Failure. As most of the
 recommended preparations overlap with or are identical to preparations 
already underway in case of numerous other XK-Class scenarios, minimal 
additional resources are required.</p>
<p>Approved by the unanimous vote of the Overseer Council on ██-██-████.</p>
