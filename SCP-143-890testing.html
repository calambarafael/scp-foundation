<p><b>Item being used:</b> One HP PageWide Pro 477 copy machine
<br><b>Internal part(s) needing to be repaired:</b> Wiring and circuit board
<br><b>Tools being utilized:</b> Scalpels produced using SCP-143
<br><b>Procedure start time:</b> 06:00</p>

<p><b>Initial procedure:</b> SCP-890 began the procedure by making a 7cm incision into the back panel of the copy machine. After exposing the wires and circuit board, SCP-890 quickly identified the faulty wires and began to extract them. After disconnecting the wires from the circuit board, SCP-890 removed the the circuit board by making four small incisions on the sides of the object. Once removed, SCP-890 replaced the circuit board with a new one and proceeded to remove the defective wires but slicing them with the scalpels produced with SCP-143. SCP-890 effectively rewired the circuit board, and proceeded to place the portion of the back panel of the copy machine back into place before stitching the area closed, ending the procedure.</p>

<p><b>Results:</b> The procedure lasted thirty five minutes before concluding. After three hours the copy machine used in this experiment was deemed fully operational.</p><hr>

<p><b>Item being used:</b> One HP PageWide Pro 477 copy machine
<br><b>Internal part(s) needing to be repaired:</b> Wiring and circuit board
<br><b>Tools being utilized:</b> Scalpels taken from the medical wing of Site-17, produced by &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;-Morton Ltd.
<br><b>Procedure start time:</b> 11:30</p>

<p><b>Initial procedure:</b> SCP-890 began the procedure by making a series of incisions along the back panel of the secondary copy machine. As SCP-890 began to lift the severed portion from the machine, additional cuts were necessary in order to completely separate the piece from the main body. Once removed, SCP-890 studied the interior of the copy machine for several moments before removing another section of paneling from the interior. At which time, SCP-890 identified the faulty wiring in the copy machine and began to use the standard set of scalpels to remove the wires. Several cuts were needed to completely sever the wires from the main circuit board. When the wires were disposed of, SCP-890 proceeded to remove the circuit board with a series of nine large incisions made not only to the circuit board itself, but the surrounding area that was connected to the circuit board. After removal, SCP-890 replaced the circuit board and wires without further hindrance, and successfully replaced the back panel, ending the procedure.</p>

<p><b>Results:</b> The procedure lasted three hours and six minutes before concluding. After an additional eighteen hours the copy machine used in this experiment was deemed fully operational.</p></td></table></a><br><hr><br>

<p><b>SCP-890:</b> The first surgery went swimmingly. I was able to perform the surgery quickly, and I've significantly increased the lifespan of my patient. Their recovery went marvelously and they were able to bounce back from the surgery almost immediately. The second patient was a bit more challenging. While their injury was the same as my previous patient, it took several passes in order for me to locate, identify, and replace the source of the injury. It was also significantly harder to replace the injured organ during the second surgery, during the previous operation the arteries cut like butter under the blade but during the second I had to make numerous incisions that would have otherwise been unnecessary. I suspect an extended recovery time for that patient will be necessary.</p></td></table></a></font></fieldset></body></html>
