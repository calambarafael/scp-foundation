<p>the dragon waits in shadows, his breath will scorch the land.<br>the hero in the castle draws his sword and makes his stand.</p>

<p>the princess in the tower is hidden far away.<br>but nothing under heaven can keep The Groom at bay.</p>

<p>they gather round with leering smiles, the soulless and the dead.<br>though her soul unwinds, the cruelest minds will keep her in her bed.</p>
