<p>"..the fifth one&rsquo;s crown was bearing down upon the fox&rsquo;s set.<br>the den was sundered with mighty thunder, an apocalypse beget.</p>

<p>on the sixth&rsquo;s day, the walls gave way, and the oceans turned to ash.<br>her birth gave work, as the earth shook, underneath the King&rsquo;s fell lash</p>

<p>the seventh bride will break the tides the moon no more will shine.<br>there comes a day not far away she&rsquo;ll birth the death of time.</p>

<p>the doctor never tells his god which one he really seeks.<br>instead he hides himself away, and quietly, he weeps.</p>

<p>their god&rsquo;s own voice, he makes the choice, declaring with their word.<br>&ldquo;in fear and pain let her remain, lest she be like the third.&rdquo;</p>

<p>the doctor&rsquo;s gun ended his run, as he put it to his ear.<br>as she was defiled, the pitied child, he gave it to his fear.</p>

<p>her memory a fickle thing, the strongest shall endure.<br>when her weeping starts to waver, their drugs make her mind pure.."</p></i></font></td></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
