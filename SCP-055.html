SCP-055</b></font><hr>
<font face='Lucida Console' size=2>
<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-055</p>
<p><b>Object Class:</b> Keter</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Object is kept 
within a five (5) by five (5) by two point five (2.5) meter square room 
constructed of cement (fifty (50) centimeter thickness), with a Faraday 
cage surrounding the cement walls. Access is via a heavy containment 
door measuring two (2) by two point five (2.5) meters constructed on 
bearings to ensure door closes and locks automatically unless held open 
deliberately. Security guards are NOT to be posted outside SCP-055's 
room. It is further advised that all personnel maintaining or studying 
other SCP objects in the vicinity try to maintain a distance of at least
 fifty (50) meters from the geometric center of the room, as long as 
this is reasonably practical.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-055 is a "self-keeping secret" or 
"anti-meme". Information about SCP-055's physical appearance as well as 
its nature, behavior, and origins is self-classifying. To clarify:</p>
<ul type=square type=square>
<li>How Site 19 originally acquired SCP-055 is unknown.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>When SCP-055 was obtained, and by whom, is unknown.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>SCP-055's physical appearance is unknown. It is not indescribable, 
or invisible: individuals are perfectly capable of entering SCP-055's 
container and observing it, taking mental or written notes, making 
sketches, taking photographs, and even making audio/video recordings. An
 extensive log of such observations is on file. However, information 
about SCP-055's physical appearance "leaks" out of a human mind soon 
after such an observation. Individuals tasked with describing SCP-055 
afterwards find their minds wandering and lose interest in the task; 
individuals tasked with sketching a copy of a photograph of SCP-055 are 
unable to remember what the photograph looks like, as are researchers 
overseeing these tests. Security personnel who have observed SCP-055 via
 closed-circuit television cameras emerge after a full shift exhausted 
and effectively amnesiac about the events of the previous hours.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>Who authorized the construction of SCP-055's containment room, why 
it was constructed in this way, or what the purpose of the described 
Containment Procedures may be, are all unknown.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>Despite SCP-055's container being easily accessible, all personnel 
at Site 19 claim no knowledge of SCP-055's existence when challenged.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these facts are periodically rediscovered, usually by chance 
readers of this file, causing a great deal of alarm. This state of 
concern lasts minutes at most, before the matter is simply forgotten 
about.</p>
<p>A great deal of scientific data has been recorded from SCP-055, but cannot be studied.</p>
<p>At least one attempt has been made to destroy SCP-055, or possibly 
move it from containment at Site 19 to another site, meeting failure for
 reasons unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-055 may present a major physical threat and indeed may have 
killed many hundreds of personnel, and we would not know it. Certainly 
it presents a gigantic memetic/mental threat, hence its Keter 
classification.</p>

<b>Document 055-1:</b> An Analysis of SCP-055</legend><hr>
<p>The author puts forward the hypothesis that SCP-055 was never 
formally acquired by &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; and is in fact an autonomous 
or remotely-controlled agent, inserted at Site 19 by an unidentified 
third party to silently observe, or interfere with:</p>
<ul type=square>
<li>activities at Site 19</li>
<li>activities at other SCP locations</li>
<li>activities of humanity worldwide</li>
<li>other SCP objects</li>

</ul>
<p>No action to counter any of these potential threats is suggested, or indeed theoretically possible.</p>

<p>Hey, if this thing really is an "anti-meme", why doesn't the fact 
that it's an "anti-meme" get wiped? We must be wrong about that somehow.
 Wait a minute, what if we were to keep notes about what it <b>isn't?</b> Would
 we remember those? <em>Bartholomew Hughes, NSA</em></p>

<b>Document 055-2:</b> Report of Dr. John Marachek</legend><hr>
<p>Survey team #19-055-127BXE was successfully able to enter SCP-055's 
container and ascertain the appearance and, to some degree, the nature 
of the object. Notes were taken according to the project methodology 
(see &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;), after which the container was sealed again.</p>
<p>Excerpt from a transcript of personnel debriefing follows:</p>
<font face='Courier New' size=2>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8 width=90% rules=none align=center><td>
<p>Dr. Hughes: Okay, I'm going to need to ask you some questions about number 55 now.</p>
<p>&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;: Number what?</p>
<p>Dr. Hughes: SCP object 55. The object you just examined.</p>
<p>&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;: Um, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't think we <em>have</em> a 55.</p>
<p>Dr. Hughes: Okay, then, &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, I'd like you to tell me what you've been doing for the past two hours.</p>
<p>&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;: What? I&hellip; &lt;subject appears uncomfortable&gt; &hellip; I don't know.</p>
<p>Dr. Hughes: Okay, then, do you remember that we all agreed that it wasn't spherical?</p>
<p>&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;: That what wasn't&hellip; Oh! Right! It isn't round at all! Object 55 isn't round!</p>
<p>Dr. Hughes: So you remember it now?</p>
<p>&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;: Well, no. I mean, I don't know what it is, but I know there 
is one. It's something you can't remember. And it's not a sphere.</p>
<p>Dr. Hughes: Wait a minute. What's not a sphere?</p>
<p>&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;: Object 55.</p>
<p>Dr. Hughes: Object what?</p>
<p>&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;: Doc, do you remember agreeing that something wasn't shaped like a sphere?</p>
<p>Dr. Hughes: Oh, right!</p>

<p>It appears to be possible to remember what SCP-055 is not (negations 
of fact), and to repeatedly deduce its existence from these memories.</p>
<p>Personnel involved in Survey #19-055-127BXE reported moderate levels 
of disorientation and psychological trauma associated with cycles of 
repeated memory and forgetfulness of SCP-055. However, no long-term 
behavioral or health problems were observed, and psych assessments of 
survey personnel showed consistent reports of this distress fading over 
time.</p>
<p>Recommendations: It may be worthwhile to post at least one staff 
member capable of remembering the existence of SCP-055 to each critical 
site.</p></fieldset></div></font></body></html>
