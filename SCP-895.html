<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-895</p>

<p><b>Object Class:</b> Euclid</p>

<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> SCP-895 is sealed 
closed and stored in an isolated underground containment cell at a depth
 of approximately 100 meters. No cameras, microphones, or other 
surveillance equipment may be brought within the 10 meter "Red Zone" 
radius of SCP-895 without express permission from at least two (2) Level
 3 personnel.</p>
 
<p>Any on-site personnel exhibiting unusual behavior or signs of 
psychological trauma are to be screened immediately, and removed from 
the site or terminated as the situation warrants.</p>

<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-895 is an ornate oak coffin 
recovered from the &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; Mortuary by SCP personnel on &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;, 
following reports of unusual footage captured by surveillance equipment 
installed at that location. When questioned, mortuary staff were unable 
to determine the source of SCP-895 and how it was transported to the 
location. Upon attempting to open SCP-895, agents on location found the 
object empty; however, observers viewing the live camera feed were [DATA
 EXPUNGED]. Until further notice, SCP-895 must remain closed at all 
times.</p>

<p>SCP-895 causes disruptions in video and photographic surveillance 
equipment within 50 meters similar to vivid, disturbing hallucinations 
with variable duration and regularity corresponding to the camera's 
proximity to SCP-895. Within a range of 5 meters from SCP-895, footage 
captured can cause severe psychological trauma and hysteria in most 
subjects. These disruptions do not extend to observers physically 
present within the area.</p></font></td></tr></table>
