<p><b>Site and Personnel Requirements:</b> Under special order of O5-&#9608;&#9608;, the following addendum is attached to the beginning of the file for SCP-231-7.<br>
<font color=black>the dragon waits in shadows, his breath will scorch the land. the hero in the castle draws his sword and makes his stand.</font><br>
All personnel assigned to SCP-231-7 must rotate out for one month of 
psychological counseling after two months on-site. SCP-231-7 is to be 
kept at an undisclosed location. All personnel assigned to SCP-231 will 
be transported there blindfolded from Site-19 by a route including no 
fewer than seven different forms of transportation, including but not 
limited to aircraft, automobile, underground tunnel, and &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;. 
Removal of the blindfold during the transport process is grounds for 
immediate termination.<br>
<font color=black>the princess in the tower is hidden far away. but nothing under heaven can keep The Groom at bay.</font><br>
Personnel assigned to SCP-231-7 must undergo heavy psychological testing
 before being cleared to enter the site. Individuals must score at least
 72 points on the Milgram Obedience Examination, be <span id="info0">unmarried</span>, have no 
<span id="info1">offspring</span>, and express nothing less than total loyalty to the 
Foundation. Normal psychological screening procedures against <span id="info2">Axis II 
disorders</span> are waived, so long as the Class-D personnel in question has 
the mental capacity to carry out Procedure 110-Montauk as needed.<br>
<font color=black>Luke 23:34.</font></font></td></tr></table>

Personnel who express <span id="info3">sympathy</span> towards SCP-231-7's <span id="info4">plight</span> and/or express
 a desire to <span id="info5">rescue</span> or <span id="info6">sympathize towards</span> SCP-231-7 will be transferred 
to another project without delay. Any actual <span id="info7">rescue</span> attempts will be met
 with immediate termination. Personnel who have served on the staff of 
SCP-231-7's Containment Team are not required to divulge that 
information to others. No official record shall be kept of the names of 
any staff assigned to SCP-231-7, nor will said service appear in the 
personnel files of said staff.<br>
<font color=black>they gather round with leering smiles, the 
soulless and the dead. though her soul unwinds, the cruelest minds will 
keep her in her bed.</font><br>
While on-site, individuals assigned to SCP-231-7 will be issued 
concealing helmets with integrated voice changers to protect their 
identity. On-site staff are not to remove said uniforms in the presence 
of other staff members. Off-duty hours are to be spent in private 
quarters alone.</p>
<p>Six Class D Personnel are to be assigned to SCP-231-7 each month for 
the purposes of carrying out Procedure 110-Montauk. <span id="info8">Violent criminals</span> 
are not to be used for this purpose due to the possibility of <span id="info9">accidental
 fatality</span> during the 110-Montauk process.</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Following repeated 
<span id="info10">escape</span> and <span id="info11">suicide</span> attempts, and based on the failure of containment for
 SCP-231-1 through 6, containment of SCP-231-7 has been amended to the 
following: SCP-231 is to be contained within a soundproof holding cell, 
adjacent to holding cells for six Class D Personnel assigned for the 
purposes of Procedure 110-Montauk. Cameras will monitor every inch of 
the cell at all times, and must be manned 24 hours a day. Malfunctioning
 monitoring equipment will be replaced without delay by psychologically 
screened staff. Doors will be magnetically locked, openable only by 
positive action by the control and monitoring facility. This includes 
all doors linking the main holding cell to those of the six Class D 
Personnel.</p>
<p>SCP-231-7 is to be kept restrained to a hospital bed at all times 
except for the purposes of Procedure 110-Montauk. Hydration will be 
provided through IV drip. Feeding will be carried out twice per day 
through feeding tube by approved medical personnel who have not <span id="info12">taken 
the Hippocratic Oath</span>. Under no circumstances are narcotics, anesthesia, 
or other unapproved medications to be administered to SCP-231-7.<br>
<font color=black>the potter told his 'prentice to prepare him seven jars. six he made with grace and skill, the last his hands did mar.</font><br>
Procedure 110-Montauk is to be carried out at least once every 24 hours 
by Class D Personnel. During Procedure 110-Montauk, at least one 
Security Clearance 4/231 staff member must monitor the procedure by 
camera at all times, although <span id="info13">the sound may be turned off</span> if the 
<span id="info14">vocalizations</span> of SCP-231-7 become <span id="info15">too distressing</span>. Following the 
procedure, all Class D Personnel must return to their holding cells or 
explosive collars will be detonated.<br>

SCP-231-1 through 7 were retrieved from &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, &#9608;&#9608;, following a 
police raid on a warehouse owned by an organization called the Children

remaining SCPs 231-2 through 231-7 and, based on notebooks recovered 
from the cult, instituted Procedure 110-Montauk to prevent future 
occurrences. <font color=black>the hens were in the henhouse and seven eggs did lay, till the fox crept in by dark of night and stole the eggs away.</font></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that recently, certain rumors have 
surfaced regarding SCP-231. Due to the drop in staff morale, I have 
decided to address some of the more prevalent points.</p>
<ul type=circle>
<li>Yes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which 
is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it 
does involve brutal [REDACTED].</li>
<li>No, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to 
the Foundation, your tendencies towards &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, or anything else.</li>
<li>No, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail.</li>
<li>Yes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have 
successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone 
who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project.</li>
<li>Yes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to 
take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, 
false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for 
recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you 
who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it.</li>
<li>No, we have not given up trying to save SCP-231-7, but research in 
that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the 
increased potency of each subsequent &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; event associated with 
each subsequent SCP-&#9608;&#9608; specimen, there is a strong possibility that 
SCP-231-7's &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; event could result in an XK class 
end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks
 recovered from the cultists (see document "Seven Brides, Seven Seals," 
SCP-231-Adjunct B).</li>
<li>No, putting the <span id="info32">poor girl</span> out of <span id="info33">her</span> misery is NOT an option. 
Neither is drugging <span id="info34">her</span>. <span id="info35">She has to be aware of what is going on</span> for 
110-Montauk to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>One final note: The Foundation does many distasteful things in the 
completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the 
price is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most 
dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682)
 but because of the danger that our resolve will fail, <span id="info36">that we will 
allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to sympathy for the 
suffering of an innocent,</span> or that we will allow ourselves to become 
monsters through the performance of monstrous acts. Just do your jobs, 
and save the philosophizing for the shrink.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
O5-&#9608;&#9608;<br>
<font color=black>Don't believe it when they say they're 
trying to save her. Why would they bother? They've got exactly what they
 want exactly where they want it.</font></p>

<p><i>231-07's emotional response to Procedure 110-Montauk appears to

<p><i>2. Administration of a Class A Amnestic to SCP-231-7, allowing

is to be administered during execution of Procedure 110-Montauk to 
maintain heightened emotional state following memory reset.</i></p>

<i>After some analysis, I have determined that it is not necessary to 
perform memory modification every time Procedure 110-Montauk is carried 
out. In fact, it is better to delay for some time before 
re-administering the agent. Analysis of Subject 231-7's emotional 
response indicates that efficacy of Procedure 110-Montauk seems to peak 
between the third and fourth performance of the procedure: <span id="info39">the dread of 
anticipation of events</span> seems to heighten emotional response for a time, 
before familiarity with the procedure begins to lessen the efficacy of 
treatment. My recommendation is that Class A Amnestics be administered 
once a week during Procedure 110-Montauk. The calendar has been modified
 accordingly.</i><br>
