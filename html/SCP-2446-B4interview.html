SCP-2446-B4 Interview</b></font><hr><br>

<p><b>Foreword:</b> On &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; an instance of SCP-2446-1
 manifested suffering from a near fatal aortic aneurysm. Following 
extensive medical intervention the instance was revived, and prepared 
for an interview in an attempt to determine the source of SCP-2446. Due 
to the instances failing health, and also signs suggesting radioactive 
decay, the instance was confined to an isolation chamber and monitored 
remotely by medical personnel and para-reality hazards specialists while
 interview was conducted via standard teleconference equipment.</p>
<p><b>Interviewed:</b> SCP-2446-B4, Instance resembles Jacob H. Wilder<a name=footnote1a href=#footnote1b><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Dr. L&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;</p>
<p><b>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</b></p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Where am I?</p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> You're at Site-&#9608;&#9608;, in the medical ward. I'm here to debrief you. To begin with, what is your name.</p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Col. Jacob Wilder, does that mean I'm out&hellip; Am I safe?<br>
<font color=black>No, you're not safe, the Foundation isn't safe.</font></p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b>[shouting] This is another trap, isn't it?! Tell me you bastards!<br>
<font color=black>Well, it is, but not for you. More of a demonstration for them.</font><br>
<b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Col. Wilder, please remain calm, sedation in your current state could be highly detrimental to your health.<br>
<font color=black>Because they care about your health now. <i>Right&hellip;</i></font><br>
<b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Like you ever cared about my health! What 
are you going to do, vivisect me? That would be ironic, wouldn't it? You
 cutting me up?<br>
<font color=black>I'm glad to see your humor survived the trauma.</font><br>
<b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please calm down Col. Wilder, or I will sedate you.</p>
<p>[SCP-2446-B4 is sedated for debrief]</p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Now then, we would like to know what happened happened to you and your team?</p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> They're probably dead, to be completely honest. We should never have followed through on the plan.<br>
<font color=black>No probably about it.</font><br>
<b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Ah, what is this plan you speak of?<br>
<font color=black>Sacrifice to the superior being to prolong your existence.</font><br>
<b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> We thought we could stop the bodies 
falling into our world. I'm assuming that I'm somewhere else if you 
don't already know that.</p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> I take it the situation was bad?</p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Thirteen separate incidents of major public manifestation, one where a four ton mass of what looked like knights <font color=black>Those guys were fun to kill.</font>manifested
 on live television. In the end, we found a corpse with advanced enough 
tech, and after some experimentation, we found where it came from. Once 
we had done that it was a simple matter to modify our existing reality 
stabilization tech to get us there.</p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Where exactly was the point of origin?</p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Judging from medical tech in this room,
 that could be difficult to explain. How advanced is this timeline? Do 
you at least have Scranton tech, or at least para-tech weapons programs,
 can you create anti-reality weapons?<font color=black>Not that those would help</font></p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> I'm not sure I would have clearance to know if we did, and if I did know I wouldn't be able to tell you.</p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> I'm going to assume that you do then; 
the lab boys brought us down to a thing they'd put together. We were all
 loaded up into the machine, and then they sent us out to deal with the 
problem. I don't know much about teleportation and how it works, but I 
couldn't see anything, couldn't move, I felt like I was suffocating, and
 everything was just black. Then, we started getting smashed around, not
 sure why that is either.</p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> You arrived at the origin location at this point?<br>
<font color=black>No, that was just what they assumed, and you know what happens when you assume, right?</font><br>
<b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Yeah, half the team was pretty beat up 
from the trip especially the last part, so we initially tried to hide 
out in a nearby forest until the team could be patched up. That was our 
first mistake. We weren't sure how close to the source we were, and of 
course we should have been more ready for a reality bender.</p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> You presumed there was a reality bender?</p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Yeah we wouldn't be deployed if it was just some portals, that would be [REDACTED]'s job, wouldn't it.</p>
<p><b>N&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> I suppose&hellip;.<br>
<font color=black>You get torn apart by killer plants.</font><br>
<b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> Anyway, any member of our task force is 
trained to make it through reality alteration, but we weren't expecting 
it have been right on top of us, and the plants just strangled about 
half the team right away, although a few of the crew kept moving for a 
long time after their heads came off&hellip;<font color=black>It was fun to watch them squirm. :)</font><br>
<br>
[SCP-2446-B4 begins showing signs of distress as sedative wears off.]<br>
[ <i>Post incident analysis suggests that SCP-2446-B4 began to experience accelerated radioactive decay at this point</i> ]</p>
<p><b>SCP-2446-B4:</b> When we tried to use our tech to get 
out, and at first we thought we were, but when the staff started trying 
to chop us up with cartoonishly large knives, we were pretty sure that 
we hadn't made it out, but about then, I blacked out, and when I woke 
up&hellip; I was here. <font color=black>Got to get some use out of you, death by heart attack isn't very entertaining.</font></p>
<p><b>&lt;End Log&gt;</b></p>
<p><b>Closing Statement:</b> Following the conclusion of this 
interview, the subject began to vomit large amounts of radioactive 
material suggesting exacerbation of earlier symptoms, resulting in 
evacuation of nearby personnel. Remote monitoring of subject reveals 
unidentified substances leaking from subject along with a massive 
increase in ambient radiation. Following this, the subject began to show
 signs of severe necrosis. Approximately three hours later, liquid 
remains of subject are retrieved and sent to cold storage. Testing 
reveals no further anomalous activity.</p></font></td></table><br>
