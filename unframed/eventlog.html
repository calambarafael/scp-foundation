Log of Extranormal Events</b></font><hr>
<font face='Lucida Console' size=2>
<p><b>Foreword:</b> This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.<br>
-Agent Carriontrooper</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> Unidentified figure appeared inside of a psychiatric facility. Security cameras captured the figure for approximately seventeen seconds as it seemingly searched for something before the figure nodded to itself and disappeared. Eye witnesses report varying details on the figure, with the only common description being that the figure had 'glowing violet eyes' and a white woolen scarf obscuring its facial features.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/2017
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; Mental Institute, PA
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> Footage seized and premises searched, amnestics administered to key witnesses.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> 3 civilians reported a glowing figure appearing in the center of a nearby lake, two cell-phone images supporting. There is no reason to believe the anomaly lasted longer than several seconds before abruptly disappearing.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; Lake Camp Grounds, &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, USA.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> Local media sources monitored, rumors involving the existence of a "lake ghost" disseminated. Special attention is to be paid to the region in the future.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> A naked, glowing humanoid figure appeared suddenly in the city's subway and seen by several eyewitnesses and captured by the security cameras. It disappeared after a few seconds.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, Spain.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> A team of disguised agents and a makeshift holographic projection unit were taken on location. Team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde 'urban shock art' exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team's supposed art group.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> Spider population of &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, a small town, quintupled over the space of three months. Not known to correspond to any significant SCP item activity.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, Nevada, USA.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> Data suppressed, area to be monitored for future natural population spikes.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> Time skips between 2.5 and &#9608;&#9608; hours took place in &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks were seemingly unaffected and displayed incorrect times in different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in &#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, Nevada, though no connection could be traced between the two events.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, North Carolina (&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, Nevada).
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> Local news reported electromagnetic interference caused by local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, Wales, was found to be abandoned. The population was found comatose in a nearby field. &#9608;&#9608; hours after the estimated time of the event, the population awoke with no recollection of the event.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> Population dosed with Class B Amnestics and a cover story was established. A road accident with a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged, an emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population given &pound;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; per head compensation. In the &#9608;&#9608; years since the event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behaviour in the population.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, a well known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, Oklahoma.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B Amnestics. Close family members of &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; were questioned and given Class A Amnestics. A cover story involving the individual's suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> Several students attending &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; Collegiate in the &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, USA.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> The monitor was confiscated and replaced for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> A mission not typically present was located in the MMORPG [REDACTED]. The mission was only accessible via a bugged area of terrain but had existed for an unknown period of time. The mission was an exact replica of Site-&#9608;&#9608; with several hostile SCPs (not necessarily those housed there) as opponents. No code for the mission was found on the game's server by Foundation Investigation teams.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> Unknown. Detected &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> Geographical location unclear.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> A viral attack on the server was performed, resulting in a total shut down. After the server was re-initialized the mission was absent. All individuals known to have found the mission have been given Class A Amnestics. There has been no recurrence to date.</p>

<p><b>Event Description:</b> The entire stock of &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; souvenirs at the &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; stall on the &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; waterfront were spontaneously altered so that the face of &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; was removed. These objects produced a loud screaming sound when exposed to daylight, and all writing implements within the stall formed symbols associated with the Cult of the Demon &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; when an attempt to write with them was made. 8 days after the event, all altered stock vanished from Foundation storage.
<br><b>Date of Occurrence:</b> &#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;/&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
<br><b>Location:</b> &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, Nova Scotia.
<br><b>Follow-up Actions Taken:</b> All altered stock seized and impounded, amnestics administered.</p></font></td></tr>
