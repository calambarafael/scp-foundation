<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-3148</p>
<p><b>Object Class:</b> Thaumiel</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> SCP-3148-1 is to be 
distributed to the leaders of national governments, high-ranking 
personnel in national militaries, and the O-5 Council. Foundation 
nuclear devices are to be armed preemptively. All Special Containment 
Procedures are herby rescinded. Foundation staff are instructed to 
utilize anomalous objects to neutralize potential threats preemptively, 
including other anomalous objects. SCP-2000
 is to prepare to undertake Procedure CYA-009. In the event that 
completion of Procedure CYA-009 is rendered impossible, Foundation 
launch facilities are to undertake Procedure SHV-258. Foundation 
personnel expressing dissent against these containment procedures will 
be terminated. No efforts are to be made to prevent the spread of 
SCP-3148.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-3148 is a communication from an 
alternate reality. It presents itself as a series of modifications to 
visual media files. SCP-3148 appears to be aimed at the leadership of 
several powerful organizations, and intends to provide warning of an 
impending K-Class end-of-the-world event. It is believed that SCP-3148 
originates from a reality in which this event was not prevented, though 
little can be ascertained about the nature of the alternate reality from
 SCP-3148. The nature of the predicted K-Class scenario is also obscure,
 but may involve an undiscovered Keter- or Apollyon-class entity.</p>
<p>SCP-3148 has informed Foundation leadership that the only adequate 
preventative measure is the use of dangerous SCP objects to neutralize 
the event, as well as other high-level threats to normalcy. Due to the 
urgency of the communications, it is believed that the Foundation has 
fewer than 2 months to prepare before the forewarned K-Class scenario 
takes place. As a result, an evacuation of the surface of the Earth is 
out of the question.</p>
<p>SCP-3148 is capable of propagating through visual media files.</p>
<p><b>Addendum 3148-1:</b> Procedure SHV-258</p>
<p>Two spacecraft with the following specifications are to be prepared 
and launched. At least two weeks of in-flight testing must take place on
 both spacecraft after launch to ensure full system functionality. Upon 
completion of testing, Phase 1 of Procedure SHV-258 begins. Phase 1 of 
Procedure SHV-258 is a standby phase, during which all mission elements 
remain in orbit. Phase 2 of Procedure SHV-258 is the primary mission 
phase, during which the mission elements preform their active duties.</p></font>

<p><b>Designation:</b> SHV-258-1</p>
<p><b>Launch Mass:</b> 13 tons</p>
<p><b>Power:</b> 35&nbsp;kW (Gallium arsenide PV cell array, Lithium thionyl chloride batteries)</p>
<p><b>Communications:</b> 29&nbsp;GHz / 30&nbsp;kW radio spot-beam (2000 Gbit/s downlink rate), 800&nbsp;MHz / 50&nbsp;W UHF receiver</p>

<p><b>Mission Description:</b> SHV-258-1 is to maintain its 
designated orbit at all times. If SHV-258-1 receives a confirmation 
signal from SHV-258-2, it is to begin transmitting the data it contains

the confirmed conclusion of Procedure SHV-258. Estimated mission length:

<p><b>Payload:</b> 2,300 (two-thousand three hundred) 
512&nbsp;TB Solid State Drives with 1.2 Exabytes of aggregate space, 
filled with compiled material from the National Archive and Records 
Administration, the Library of Congress, the UK National Archives, the 
French Archives Administration, 30 University archives, select web 
databases, and the Foundation Database. 1 (one) in-vitro gestation 
device, equipped to bring 300 human embryos to term. Both hard drives 
and embryos are to be shielded from cosmic ray bombardment using the 
argon fuel tanks and lead shielding. 1 (one) gamma ray sensor. 1 (one) 
low-energy charged particle detector. 1 (one) optical spectroscope.</p>
<p><b>Mission Description:</b> SHV-258-2 is to remain on 
standby and maintain its designated orbit until it receives radio 
confirmation to begin Phase 2 of Procedure SHV-258. Phase 2 may also be 
triggered by sufficiently high gamma ray readings from the direction of 
Earth or a cessation of radio communications from Foundation ground 
stations. SHV-258-2 will send a confirmation signal to SHV-258-1 and 
will then attempt to exit the solar system. The onboard command module 
will calculate an efficient trajectory and execute the necessary burns. 
Once SHV-258-2 is on a trajectory to leave the Solar System, all 
non-essential systems are to be disabled, and the spacecraft will go 
into hibernation. If SHV-258-2 detects a change in the flow direction of
 low-energy charged particles around it, some systems will be partially 
enabled to allow further investigation. If a possible life-bearing 
planet is detected in the vicinity of SHV-258-2, the contents of the 
onboard SSDs are to be broadcast openly. SHV-258-2 is not to change its 
trajectory at any time unless met with a responding signal. Further 
directives for SHV-258-2 have been classified. Estimated mission length:
 Indefinite.</p></font></td></table><br>

<p>SCP-1055</p>
<p>SCP-1055 has been relocated to an undisclosed location near Site-19. 
ALL documentation for SCP-1055 has been declassified and printed copies 
have been distributed to all Site-77 staff. We all know the danger that 
place represents, and we&rsquo;re a willing to take the necessary sacrifice to
 get rid of it. After the confirmed elimination of all or most anomalous
 objects contained at Site-19, all Site-77 personnel will voluntarily 
commit suicide. I hope you can forgive us.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what day it is. Maybe the concept doesn&rsquo;t even apply anymore.</p>
<p>Everything failed. <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000">Ganymede</a>
 was our best hope, and the facility was overrun on the first day, that 
first terrible day. It quieted down real fast after that. Shiva was 
always something of a half-baked idea, and it went about as well as 
you&rsquo;d expect. The second one made it off the ground at least, but we 
lost contact with mission control while it was still on the way up. A 
couple days after that, we got a short message from the launch site. 
Apparently the rocket was swallowed by some temporal anomaly before it 
got to orbit.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, all that&rsquo;s left are a few pockets, almost all 
ex-Foundation, but communication has been tense and spotty. From what 
I&rsquo;ve seen of the outside, the only thing keeping us alive are the 
Scranton Anchors and the containment systems themselves.</p>
<p>You know this whole thing is almost funny to me. It really is fucking hilarious.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have seen it coming. Could have stopped it.</p>
<p>In any case. To anyone still listening: this is O5-13. I&rsquo;m the last 
remaining council member. I'd like to thank you all for your service and
 formally apologize. We were wrong.</p>
