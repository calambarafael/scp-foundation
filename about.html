About The Foundation</b></font><hr>
<font face='Lucida Console' size=2>
<font face='Consolas'><h1>Mission Statement</h1></font>
<p>Operating clandestine and worldwide, the Foundation operates beyond 
jurisdiction, empowered and entrusted by every major national government
 with the task of containing anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena.
 These anomalies pose a significant threat to global security by 
threatening either physical or psychological harm.</p>
<p>The Foundation operates to maintain normalcy, so that the worldwide 
civilian population can live and go on with their daily lives without 
fear, mistrust, or doubt in their personal beliefs, and to maintain 
human independence from extraterrestrial, extradimensional, and other 
extranormal influence.</p>
<p>Our mission is three-fold:</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Secure</h2></font>
<p>The Foundation secures anomalies with the goal of preventing them 
from falling into the hands of civilian or rival agencies, through 
extensive observation and surveillance and by acting to intercept such 
anomalies at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Contain</h2></font>
<p>The Foundation contains anomalies with the goal of preventing their 
influence or effects from spreading, by either relocating, concealing, 
or dismantling such anomalies or by suppressing or preventing public 
dissemination of knowledge thereof.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Protect</h2></font>
<p>The Foundation protects humanity from the effects of such anomalies 
as well as the anomalies themselves until such time that they are either
 fully understood or new theories of science can be devised based on 
their properties and behavior. The Foundation may also neutralize or 
destroy anomalies as an option of last resort, if they are determined to
 be too dangerous to be contained.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h1>Foundation Operations</h1></font>
<p>Foundation covert and clandestine operations are undertaken across the globe in pursuit of our primary missions.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2></font>
<p>The Foundation maintains an extensive database of information 
regarding anomalies requiring Special Containment Procedures, commonly 
referred to as "SCPs". The primary Foundation database contains 
summaries of such anomalies and emergency procedures for maintaining or 
re-establishing safe containment in the case of a containment breach or 
other event.</p>
<p>Anomalies may take many forms, be it an object, an entity, a 
location, or a free-standing phenomenon. These anomalies are categorized
 into one of several <a href=objectclasses.html>Object Classes</a> and are either contained at one of the Foundation's myriad Secure Facilities or contained on-site if relocation is deemed unfeasible.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Operational Security</h2></font>
<p>The Foundation operates with the utmost secrecy. All Foundation personnel must observe the Security Clearance Levels
 as well as need-to-know and compartmentalization of information. 
Personnel found in violation of Foundation security protocols will be 
identified, detained, and subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Rival Agencies and Groups of Interest</h2></font>
<p>The Foundation is not the only organization with knowledge of and 
capability to interact with or utilize anomalies. While some of these Groups of Interest
 have similar goals and may cooperate with us on issues of global 
security, many more are opportunistic and profit-oriented, seeking to 
adapt or use anomalies to their own ends. Foundation personnel are 
instructed to treat individuals from such groups with suspicion at all 
times, and collaboration with such groups without the explicit prior 
consent of Foundation leadership will be cause for termination or other 
disciplinary action.</p></font></body></html>
