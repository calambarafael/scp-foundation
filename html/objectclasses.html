Object Classes</b></font><hr>
<font face='Lucida Console' size=2>
<p>All anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena requiring Special 
Containment Procedures are assigned an Object Class for purposes of 
research priority, budgeting, and other considerations. The class 
assigned to an object is generally determined by a number of factors, 
but most importantly by a combination of its difficulty to contain as 
well as the danger posed to Foundation personnel and humanity at large.</p>
<p>A particular anomaly's classification is subject to update and 
modification as research and our understanding of the object, entity, or
 phenomenon improves.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h1>Primary Classes</h1></font>
<p>These are the most common Object Classes assigned to anomalies, and make up the bulk of the Foundation's database.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Safe</h2></font>
<p>Safe-class objects are those anomalies that are either sufficiently 
understood that they are now completely and reliably contained on a 
permanent basis or otherwise do not trigger their anomalous effects 
unless intentionally activated.</p>
<p>Classifying an anomaly as Safe, however, does not mean that handling 
or activating it does not pose a threat, and personnel are to be 
reminded that all Special Containment Procedures and safety protocols 
are to be observed at all times.</p>

<font face='Consolas'><h2>Euclid</h2></font>
<p>Euclid-class objects are anomalies that are either insufficiently 
understood or inherently unpredictable, such that reliable containment 
is not always possible, but do not pose sufficient threat to qualify for
 Keter classification. The vast majority of anomalies cataloged and 
contained by the Foundation are initially classified as Euclid until 
they are either sufficiently understood or exhibit sufficient danger to 
qualify for reclassification.</p>
<p>In particular, any anomaly that exhibits autonomy, sentience and/or sapience
 is generally classified a Euclid-class entity at minimum, due to the 
inherent unpredictability of an object that can act or think on its own.</p>

<font face='Consolas'><h2>Keter</h2></font>
<p>Keter-class objects are anomalies that pose an inherently serious 
threat to the safety of Foundation personnel and the rest of mankind and
 either require extensive and complex procedures to contain or cannot be
 fully contained by the Foundation's current technology and knowledge.</p>
<p>These anomalies are generally considered the most dangerous ones in 
Foundation containment, and all research efforts are directed towards 
enabling more reliable containment of such anomalies or, as a last 
resort, the timely neutralization or destruction of its anomalous 
effects.</p>

<font face='Consolas'><h1>Secondary Classes</h1></font>
<p>The following Object Classes are sub-classes that supplement the object's primary (or former) classification.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Neutralized</h2></font>
<p>Neutralized anomalies are those that are no longer anomalous, either 
through having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed, disabled, 
or otherwise no longer function or exhibit anomalous effects.</p>
<p>The documentation for Neutralized anomalies is archived for posterity
 in case the anomaly regains its anomalous properties or otherwise 
recurs in the future.</p>

<font face='Consolas'><h2>Explained</h2></font>
<p>Explained anomalies are 
those that are completely and fully understood to the point where their 
effects are now explainable by mainstream science, have been debunked as
 a false or mistaken classification, or are so widespread and publicly 
disseminated such that containment is no longer possible.</p>

<font face='Consolas'><h1>Esoteric Classes</h1></font>
<p>The following Object Classes fall outside of the purview of standard classification.</p>
<font face='Consolas'><h2>Thaumiel</h2></font>
<p>Thaumiel-class objects are highly classified and extremely rare 
anomalies that are utilized by the Foundation to contain or counteract 
the effects of other highly dangerous anomalies, especially Keter-class 
objects. Even the mere existence of Thaumiel-class objects is classified
 at the highest levels of the Foundation and their locations, functions,
 and current status are known to few Foundation personnel outside of the
 O5 Council.</p></font></body></html>
