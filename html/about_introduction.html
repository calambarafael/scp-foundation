<p><b>Mankind in its present state 
has been around for a quarter of a million years, yet only the last 
4,000 have been of any significance.</b></p>
<p>So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 
years? We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things
 that we didn't understand. It was more than explaining why the sun came
 up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men and rocks 
that came to life. So we called them 'gods' and 'demons', begged them to
 spare us, and prayed for salvation.</p>
<p>In time, their numbers dwindled and 
ours rose. The world began to make more sense when there were fewer 
things to fear, yet the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the 
universe demands the absurd and impossible.</p>
<p><b>Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear.</b> No one else
will protect us, and we must stand up for ourselves.</p>
While the rest of mankind dwells in the 
light, we must stand in the darkness to fight it, contain it, and shield
 it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane and 
normal world.<br>
