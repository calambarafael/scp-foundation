SCP-093</b></font><hr>
<font face='Lucida Console' size=2>
<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-093</p>
<p><b>Object Class:</b> Euclid</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> See Document 093-T1 for outline of testing conditions. SCP-093 must remain on a 
mirror at all times and under video surveillance. Admittance into the 
area of SCP-093's containment must be authorized only with proper video 
recording and subject retrieval procedures in place. Any attempt to use 
SCP-093 outside of an approved test will be dealt with severely, up to 
and including termination.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-093 is a primarily red disc carved 
from a stone composite resembling cinnabar, with circular engravings and
 unknown symbols carved at 0.5&nbsp;cm depth around the entire object. 
Deeper cuts are present on SCP-093 with a depth of 1 to 1.5&nbsp;cm. 
SCP-093 is 7.62&nbsp;cm in diameter and fits comfortably into most palms
 without abrasion. SCP-093 will change hue when held by a living 
individual. The colors taken by SCP-093 are still being researched to 
establish a link. Current belief holds that the changes depend upon 
regrets carried by the holder.</p>
<p>If SCP-093 is removed from a mirror and not held by a person, it will
 seek out the nearest mirror-like surface. SCP-093 has been observed to 
travel in the largest possible circle while rolling, building up 
phenomenal speed. The mechanism of this acceleration is currently 
unknown. If an obstacle is between SCP-093 and the nearest mirror-like 
surface, it will use this momentum to punch through the obstacle and 
continue on its course at this speed. It will only stop when a 
mirror-like surface is contacted. Despite tremendous impact velocities, 
no damage will be dealt to SCP-093 or the mirror.</p>
<p><b>Additional Notes:</b> No records exist to clarify the 
nature of SCP-093's discovery or presence in the Foundation. See 
Document 093-OD. Since no records exist explaining SCP-093's method of 
containment, a test procedure was initiated to establish why mirrors 
must be used to contain it. The results of Document 093-T1 lead to the 
discovery of living beings holding SCP-093 being able to move through 
mirrors and the series of tests in Document 093-T2 to ascertain the 
destination reached through this travel.</p>

<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-093</p>
<p><b>Object Class:</b> Euclid</p>
<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Item SCP-093 is to 
be kept on a silver lined mirror on a 0.3x0.23m (1ftx9in) pedestal at 
least 1.22m (4ft) off the ground floor in containment cell block &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;. 
Object is not to be contained in areas exceeding 3.66x3.05m (12x10ft) 
nor placed on mahogany, pine, cherry or aluminum pedestals above or 
below level 1 of containment cell block &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;. Object can be handled 
safely, albeit gently, without consequences. Tests and consequences 
thereof involving containment conditions can be viewed in Section-B:35-1
 of the attached report.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Object was found on the shore of the 
Red Sea, 30 Jan 1968, emitting a low sigh and a dim blue gleam. Its 
color has since turned into an orange mix of red only emitting a hum of 
varying volume whilst in the presence of female examiners of ages 
between 34 and 41. SCP-093 resembled the documented blue for 54:34 at 
1:23 on 26 April 1986 coincidentally when the body of 194-9834 was 
discovered in Research Facility &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;.</p>
<p>Ties between 194-9834 and SCP-093 remain inconclusive and effects of 
prolonged exposure to 093 remain unknown except for infrequent reports 
of periods of calmness and in the case of 242-0049 as periodic waves of 
depression, loss of balance and thoughts of suicide. These feelings have
 reportedly not exceeded eleven days in duration. Object seemed to react
 to the presence of 242-0056 by turning light violet for no more than 
2:09, as documented on 12 March 1993. Effects of this reaction remain 
unknown.</p>
<p><b>Additional Notes:</b> Origins of 093 remain unknown and 
documents of recovery of 093 have since been destroyed in a fire in 
Research Facility &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, 09 December 1989. Reports on the feelings of 
researchers who handled 093 have remained inconsequential since 19 April
 1995.</p>

<b>Document 093-T1:</b> Containment Test</legend><hr>
<p>Testing of SCP-093 against conditions set forth for existing 
containment procedures to assess viability of continuing such 
containment. Beginning with changing the type of mirror used as a 
position of rest:</p>
<p><b>Mirrored surface, brass frame, retail-grade mirror:</b> 
SCP-093 rests without activity when placed on the mirror. This test 
alone removes the need for costly silver or wooden containment systems.</p>
<p><b>Standard-grade table:</b> SCP-093 turns upright and 
begins to roll across the table surface in one direction, making a 
U-turn and rolling to the other, completing an oval shape and repeating 
this action until a mirror is brought into vicinity of it, at which time
 SCP-093 rolls toward the mirror and lays flatways against it, sliding 
toward the center. It is noted that despite the grainy feel of SCP-093, 
it does not mark the mirror in any fashion while moving across it.</p>
<p><b>Two mirrors at either end of a standard-grade table:</b>
 SCP-093 gravitates toward the closer mirror regardless of orientation 
and makes no distinction between different types of mirrors, favoring a 
factor of distance above all else in choosing the mirror to move to.</p>
<p><b>A mirror held by a person and moved around:</b> SCP-093 
follows the mirror as it moves, gaining speed until a maximum velocity 
of &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; is reached. At any velocity, the impact of SCP-093 against a 
mirrored surface results in no damage to either object.</p>
<p><b>A person holding SCP-093 placing it on a mirror:</b> 
This test was accidental, the result of one of the staff tripping 
another. As a
 result of the behavior of the researchers, it was discovered that a 
person holding SCP-093 and placing it against a mirror will in fact move
 into the mirror.</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> Containment testing discontinued after 
establishing that SCP-093 requires only a mirror to rest inert. Testing 
on human interaction with mirrors while holding SCP-093 authorized by 
Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;.</p></fieldset></div>

<p><b>Testing Protocols</b>: Subjects testing SCP-093 must 
wear a Class 3 buckle harness strapped to the chest and attached to a 
tension pulley system allowing for 300&nbsp;m (~1000 ft) of movement. 
Additional spools may be added to extend movement if necessary. The 
clasps connecting these spools must be high grade and capable of 
withstanding applied force of 0.2 tons.</p>
<p>A field kit containing the following should be standard issue for testing of SCP-093:</p>
<ul type=square>
<li>One (1) wrist mounted light source with three (3) hours lifespan and
 additional power sources providing up to six (6) additional hours.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>Four (4) 0.5&nbsp;L water bottles with water.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>Four (4) MREs of any type, plus two (2) plain granola bars (chocolate chips allowed).</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>One (1) standard-issue Beretta 9mm firearm with twenty-four (24) 
rounds of ammunition, loaded. This is not to be issued until subject has
 passed into a mirror using SCP-093 and should be given under armed 
supervision ensuring that the subject passes through entirely. This item
 is to be requisitioned first upon subject's return and subject to be 
made aware of this before leaving line of sight within SCP-093's mirror.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=square>
<li>One (1) standard-issue field knife. The subject is not to be made aware of this item and must find it on his own within the kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject must also be attached to a video system, with a camera 
mounted on the subject's head or shoulders. The video device should be 
cable based and allow for the same length of travel as the return 
system. Wireless cameras have shown mixed results and should only be 
used in testing conditions where SCP-093 is a currently known color. New
 colors must be tested using wired feed.</p>
<p>During testing, the color of SCP-093 must be recorded, as well as 
history of the subject in terms of their incarceration to identify how 
SCP-093 determines the color to assume. A link appears to be connected 
to guilt or a lack thereof in the subject's psyche. The attached test 
results should be read in order.</p>
