<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-087</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-087 is located 
on the campus of [REDACTED]. The doorway leading to SCP-087 is 
constructed of reinforced steel with an electro-release lock mechanism. 
It has been disguised to resemble a janitorial closet consistent with 
the design of the building. The lock mechanism on the doorknob will not 
release unless &#9608;&#9608; volts are applied in conjunction with 
counter-clockwise rotation of the key. The inside of the door is lined 
with 6 centimeters of industrial foam padding.</p>
<p>Due to the results of the final exploration (see Document 087-4), no personnel are permitted access to SCP-087.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-087 is an unlit platform staircase.
 Stairs descend on a 38 degree angle for 13 steps before reaching a 
semicircular platform of approximately 3 meters in diameter. Descent 
direction rotates 180 degrees at each platform. The design of SCP-087 
limits subjects to a visual range of approximately 1.5 flights. A light 
source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-087, as there are no 
lighting fixtures or windows present. Lighting sources brighter than 75 
watts have shown to be ineffective, as SCP-087 seems to absorb excess 
light.</p></font></td></tr></table>

<p>Subjects report and audio recordings confirm the distressed 
vocalizations from what is to be a child between the ages of &#9608; and &#9608;&#9608;. 
The source of the distress calls is estimated to be located 
approximately 200 meters below the initial platform. However, any 
attempts to descend the staircase have failed to bring subjects closer 
to the source. The depth of descent calculated from Exploration IV, the 
longest exploration, is shown to be far beyond both the possible 
structure of both the building and geological surroundings. At this 
time, it is unknown if SCP-087 has an endpoint.</p>

<p>SCP-087 has undergone four video recorded explorations by Class-D 
personnel. Each subject conducting an exploration has encountered 
SCP-087-1, which appears as a face with no visible pupils, nostrils, or 
mouth. The nature of SCP-087-1 is entirely unclear, but it has been 
determined that it is not the source of the pleading. Subjects exhibit 
feelings of intense paranoia and fear when faced with SCP-087-1, but it 
is undetermined whether said feelings are abnormal or simply natural 
reactions.</p></font></td>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong><br>
Over a period of 2 weeks following Exploration IV, several members of 
the staff and students from the [REDACTED] campus reported knocking at a
 variable rate of 1-2 seconds per knock coming from the interior of 
SCP-087. The door leading to SCP-087 has been fitted with 6 centimeter 
thick industrial padding. All reports of knocking have ceased.</p>

<p><i>D-8432 is a 43-year old Caucasian male of average build and 
appearance and unremarkable psychological background. Subject is equipped with a 75 watt flood lamp with battery power capable of 
lasting 24 hours, a handheld camcorder fitted with a transmission 
stream, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; at 
Control.</i></p>
<p><i>D-8432 steps through doorway onto initial platform. Despite the 
wattage, the flood lamp only illuminates the first 9 steps. The second 
platform is not visible.</i></p>
<p><b>D-8432:</b> It's fucking dark.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Is your flood lamp functioning properly?</p>
<p><i>D-8432 shines the light out the door and into the academic building's hallway. The light reaches significantly further.</i></p>
<p><b>D-8432:</b> Yeah, it's working, it just won't light these stairs all the way down.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Thank you. Please continue.</p>
<p><i>D-8432 descends for 13 steps before reaching the second platform.
 The platform is in the shape of a semicircle with an apparently 
concrete surface and walls. There are no distinct markings, aside from 
nondescript patches of dust, dirt, or wear consistent with that which is
 found in a typical concrete stairwell. D-8432 rotates 180 degrees to 
begin descent down the second flight, then pauses.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Reason for stopping?<br>
<b>D-8432:</b> You hear that? There's a fucking kid down there. Sounds like one.</p>
<p><i>None of the described audio is feeding through the camera or mic at this time.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Could you please describe the sound?<br>
<b>D-8432:</b> It's young. Either female or a very young boy. It's crying and sobbing and saying <i>[pause]</i> please <i>[pause]</i> help <i>[pause]</i> please <i>[pause]</i> Yeah, it keeps repeating that and crying.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Can you estimate its distance from your current location?<br>
<b>D-8432:</b> Uh, fuck, I don't know, maybe 200 meters down?<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please continue down the next flight.</p>
<p><i>The subject descends another 13 steps. As he reaches the landing,
 audio of the child as described is picked up. The child alternates 
between sobbing, wailing, and the words "please," "help," and "down 
here." The level of audio is consistent with D-8432's report of it being
 approximately 200 meters below.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Can you still hear the crying?<br>
<b>D-8432:</b> Yeah.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> We're picking it up as well. Please continue down. Stop if you notice any changes in the audio or environment.</p>
<p><i>The subject descends another 3 flights of stairs before stopping.</i></p>
<p><b>D-8432:</b> Keep going?<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please.</p>
<p><i>D-8432 continues another 17 flights (total of 22 flights) before 
stopping. There are no visual changes in the environment, and each 
flight has been a consistent 13 steps.</i></p>
<p><b>D-8432:</b> I'm not getting any fucking closer to the kid.</p>
<p><i>Stereo audio confirms that the crying noise has not increased in volume and remains approximately 200 meters below the subject.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Noted. Please continue.</p>
<p><i>The subject continues another 28 flights before stopping. (50 
flights total.) D-8432 is standing on the 51st landing, counting the 
initial ground level landing. D-8432 is estimated to be 200 meters below
 the initial platform. 34 minutes have elapsed. The volume of the crying
 has not increased.</i></p>
<p><b>D-8432:</b> I feel a little uneasy.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> You've spent a long time in a dark, unknown stairwell. It's natural. Please continue.</p>
<p><i>The subject hesitates before stepping down on the next stair. As 
the subject moves forward, the flood lamp illuminates a face located 
approximately at the bottom of the flight (SCP-087-1). It appears to be 
the same size and shape as a human head, except it is lacking a mouth, 
nostrils, and pupils. The face is completely motionless, but is making 
direct eye contact, indicating its awareness of D-8432.</i></p>
<p><b>D-8432:</b> [Yelling] Fuck! What the fuck is that? Shit! Holy fucking shit. What the fuck!<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Can you please describe what you see?<br>
<b>D-8432:</b> It's some sort of fucking person face thing and it's fucking looking right at me fuck fuck fuck it's looking right at me &mdash;<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Is it moving?<br>
<b>D-8432:</b> <i>[pause, heavy breathing]</i> No, it's just staring at me. Fuck fuck fuck it's creepy.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please approach and further illuminate the entity.<br>
<b>D-8432:</b> Fuck fuck fuck I don't want to fucking &mdash;</p>
<p><i>The face jerks forward about 50 centimeters directly toward D-8432.</i></p>
<p><b>D-8432:</b> <i>[yelling]</i> Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck [REDACTED]</p>
<p><i>D-8432 enters a panicked state and rapidly ascends SCP-087. 
D-8432 reaches the ground floor in 18 minutes, at which time he 
collapses and passes out. There is no sign of SCP-087-1. Review of the 
footage indicates an equal number of flights and steps ascending as 
descending. Audio of the crying and pleading remains at the same volume 
until the last flight, at which point it ceases. Medical reports 
indicate collapse was a result of the rapid ascension of the stairs, 
causing fatigue.</i></p></fieldset></div>

<p><b>D-9035:</b> You wan' me to go down there, Doc?<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please shine your flood lamp outside of SCP-087 to verify it is functioning properly.</p>
<p><i>D-9035 shines the light into the hallway. Comparison with the footage from Exploration I confirms it is indeed brighter.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Thank you. Please continue to the first landing.<br>

<p><i>D-9035 pauses for 18 seconds, then descends 13 steps to the first landing and stops.</i></p>
<p><b>D-9035:</b> Is that a kid?<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please remove one of the adhesive lights and affix it to the wall on the landing.<br>
<b>D-9035:</b> Doc, you hear that? Is that a kid down there?<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> That's unconfirmed. Please affix an adhesive light to the wall and verify it functions.</p>
<p><i>D-9035 hesitates, then removes one of the lights from his 
backpack and adheres it to the wall. He presses on the light, and it 
turns on.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please turn off your flood lamp.</p>
<p><i>D-9035 hesitates again before turning off the lamp. The LED light
 illuminates the landing, but does not extend beyond the first step 
either way.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Thank you. You may turn your flood lamp 
back on. Please continue to descend. At each landing, affix an LED light
 to the wall and turn it on. If you notice anything unusual, please 
report it.</p>
<p><i>D-9035 turns the flood lamp back on, then descends the next 
flight of stairs. As he sets foot on the landing, the audio picks up 
sounds of pleading and crying, consistent with those of the first 
exploration.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Can you still hear the previously reported audio?<br>
<b>D-9035:</b> Uh, yeah. She sounds 'bout 150, maybe 200 meters down. Am I supposed to get her? Look, Doc. I don't do good with kids.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please place the light and continue down until you notice anything unusual.</p>
<p><i>The subject adheres the light to the wall and turns it on, then 
continues to the next landing. He adheres the third LED light to the 
wall and turns it on. D-9035 continues in this manner for the next 25 
flights before stopping.</i></p>
<p><b>D-9035:</b> I don't think I'm getting any closer to the kid, doc.<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> How far below would you estimate the source of the sound to be?<br>

<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Thank you. Please proceed.</p>
<p><i>D-9035 continues in the same fashion for the next 24 flights. At 
the 51st landing he stops. Footage shows an arced gouge in the concrete 
wall, estimated to be approximately 50 centimeters long and 10 
centimeters wide. The first step down from the landing appears to be 
completely smashed into rubble.</i></p>
<p><b>D-9035:</b> You see that?<br>
<b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Yes. Can you please describe what you see?<br>
<b>D-9035:</b> Looks like something slashed at the wall, and 
the step over here's all crumbled up and stuff. The slash mark looks 
really smooth -</p>
<p><i>D-9035 touches the gouge mark.</i></p>
<p><b>D-9035:</b> Yeah, it's smooth. Feels like glass.<br>

<p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><i>D-9035 steps over the destroyed step and continues down the 
staircase. Nothing is notable at the next landing. D-9035 adheres an LED
 light to the wall and continues in the same fashion for another 38 
flights. The sound of the crying and pleading still has not gotten 
closer. D-9035 is on the 89th landing and 74 minutes have elapsed from 
the beginning of the exploration. Subject is estimated to be 350 meters

<p><i>D-9035 stops talking and moving as the flood lamp illuminates 
SCP-087-1. The face is staring directly at D-9035, again indicating 
awareness of the subject's presence. Although SCP-087-1 appears to be 
unmoving, its location is 38 flights below the initial encounter in 
Exploration I, indicating it is mobile.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Is there a reason you stopped?<br>
<b>D-9035:</b> <i>[unresponsive]</i></p>
<p><i>D-9035's breathing grows labored. SCP-087-1 remains immobile for an additional 13 seconds. SCP-087-1 blinks.</i></p>
<p><b>D-9035:</b> <i>[yelling, incomprehensible]</i></p>
<p><i>SCP-087-1 jerks forward until it is approximately 90 centimeters from D-9035. Subject turns and flees up the stairs.</i></p>
<p><b>Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;:</b> Please relax and calm down. Turn around. We need a closer look at the face.</p>

<p><i>D-9035 is unresponsive, but labored breathing can be heard 
through the audio feed. For the next 14 minutes, D-9035 is immobile. The
 visual feed is black, and audio picks up only the subject's breathing 
and the continuous pleading coming from below. After 14 minutes and 32 
seconds of unchanging visual and audio feeds, the sound of a rapid 
heartbeat not consistent with a human heartbeat, and a low cracking 
noise is heard. 7 seconds later, D-9035 gasps and revives, continuing 
his ascent of the stairs rapidly and wordlessly. The heartbeat and 
cracking cease, and nothing abnormal is detected on the visual feed. He 
remains unresponsive. D-9035 exits SCP-087 and sits on the floor outside
 of the entrance.</i></p>
<p><i>D-9035 then enters a catatonic state from which he has not yet recovered.</i></p></fieldset></div>

screeching noise from the audio feed. It then cuts to bumpy visuals of 
D-9884 descending the stairs rapidly.</i></p>
<p><b>D-9884:</b> <i>[panicked and hysterical]</i> It's been
 following me! This whole time it's been right behind me oh God it's 
right behind me it was looking right at me! Dr. &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; please do 
something please help me oh God no please get it away please no please I
 knew it was following me help make it leave please no it was looking at
 me it was staring at me it knew I was here it's been watching me this 
whole time oh God please help me no please <i>[this continues in a similar fashion until the end.]</i></p>
<p><i>D-9884 continues to scream and plead hysterically as she rapidly 
descends the staircase. The previously heard static-like screeching 
seems to overlay the audio feed, beneath which can still be heard the 
original sound of the crying child. Approximately 14 flights down, the 
video feed swings to show the area directly behind D-9884. The face is 
now approximately 20 centimeters from the camera lens. It is not staring
 at the subject; rather it is fixated on the camera lens, giving the 
illusion it is making eye contact with those viewing the footage. It is 
important to note that since the sighting of SCP-087-1, the sound of the
 girl crying and pleading has been increasing in volume, indicating 
D-9884 is nearing the source. After an approximate 150 panicked flights 
of descent with 3 visual confirmations of SCP-087-1 still in pursuit, 
D-9884 trips and appears to fall unconscious. Audio feed indicates 
strong proximity to the source of the crying. The static and screeching 
noise continue. Video feed shows yet another descending flight of 
stairs, indicating D-9884 still has not reached the base of the 
stairwell. 12 seconds of motionlessness pass before the face comes in 
full view of the camera, eye contact being made directly with the 
viewer.</i></p>
